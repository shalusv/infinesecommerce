1- the table should be responsive,
2- may be in some cas e as screen becomes smaller some column field should move into the exapnded section which has table strucutre to accomodate the extra comns,
3- main row should contains the comun according to my specification, that is G768=true,L768=true,L650=false,L550=false,L450=false measns the comun willbe in the main row for >768px and <768px but moved to expandeble table whne viewport is <650px,<550px,<450p[c],
4- the expansion and collapse of each row must look like an accordion,
5-the column visble on the main should be srtbale except action hutton which containi edit adn delete and expand button(as only icons)
